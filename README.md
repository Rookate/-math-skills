This is a project about calculating the following
===================================================

### Average : 
The sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list.

For example, that mean average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5.

### Median : 

_The median is the value in the middle of a data set, meaning that 50% of data points have a value smaller or equal to the median and 50% of data points have a value higher or equal to the median._

 #### For an odd data set : 

1. Sort data : Arrange the values of the data set from smallest to largest.

2. Find the central index : Calculate the central index of your data set using the following formula : 

    central_index=(n+1)/2, n is the total number of values

3. Identify the median: The median is the value located at the central index.


_For exemple : 1, 3, 5, 11, 12 (5+1) / 2 = 3. The median is the value located at the central index, so it's 5_
